POC Project of .NetStandard 2.0 and its interaction with Xamarin, Universal Windows Platform, .Net Core 2.0 and .Net Framework.

The goal of this POC is to parse the HTML of a page from www.allocine.fr listing the new movies of the week in France, and listing it in a NetStandard Project. The site should also offer the user to export the list in a pdf document.

Update 1 - 24/08/2017 - UWP is not compatible with .Net Standard 2.0 yet.

Update 2 - 25/08/2017 - Due to the incompatibility of some nuget with Xamarin Android and Xamarin iOS (alphas), these parts have been canceled.
